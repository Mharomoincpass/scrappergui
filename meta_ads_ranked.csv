61555427913037,"My Alpha mate rejected and tortured me for his half-dead love. In retaliation, I hid my pregnancy and ran away, only to find my second chance mate is - the Alpha of our enemy pack! *** Chapter 1 - An unwanted mate bond My own mate rejected me on our wedding night. As soon as I signed the marriage certificate and prepared to consummate our new life together...he rejected me. “I, Than Sable, Alpha of the Amber Desert Pack, reject you Kaia Glace as my Luna.” I remember his cruel cutting words as if they were only yesterday. But they weren’t, his rejection of our mate bond was two years ago. The words still resound in my ears even after all this time. Time, I have wasted being a semi-Luna. Time wasted with a mate that doesn’t even want me. Than and I met at college. The noisy corridors of college seem like a lifetime ago now, so does the Than I knew back then. As soon as we returned to the Amber Desert Pack, he took on his position as the Alpha. I happily followed to become his Luna, as his mate. The caring and supportive Than I knew at college changed instantly as soon as we were married. He rejected me even before our wedding night, even before marking me. I’ve gone over and over again in my head what I must have said, what I did wrong, but each time I came up empty. Every time I asked him, I would get a grunt or an inaudible murmur, so I stopped asking. His complete reversal in character makes me feel as if I imagined our college days, as if they didn’t even exist and I was living in a dream world. An illusion. Our mate bond is non-existent. That’s a lie, it exists but he doesn’t allow himself to get close to me, doesn’t allow himself to be alone in a room with me. It’s as if I disgust him. That it pains him to get close to me. I hate our mate bond. The very thing that makes my heart flutter as he gets into the room, or the scent of roasted chestnuts that lingers on the furniture. Even his auburn shaded hair, muscular alpha body and hazel eyes I have come to hate. I hate the way the mate bond tricks me every day. For an entire year after our wedding there was hardly a time that I saw Than, especially alone. He became exceedingly busy with pack affairs and used it as an excuse to stay away from me. I tried to solve the issue I may have caused, to save our marriage. I must have done something wrong... But when I found out what the real problem in our marriage was, I stopped trying. I gave up...because it was just too insurmountable. So, for the last year I’ve remained quiet in the house he has assigned to me. In all honesty, I’ve grown tired of the life I lead, this wasn’t the life I imagined for myself. I tried to communicate with Than. I tried to put across my case to leave the Amber Desert pack, but he always said that there was still time. I’m not sure what kind of measure of time he was referring to, but I felt out of time. Anyway, it turned out that I was his ""Luna"", but in reality, I was his imprisoned canary. However, I never gave up and ran, because I felt that my life should not be like this, and besides, I also had my own things that needed to be resolved. “Kaia?” His growl reaches my ears as I sit in my bedroom, an internal sigh escaping me for his disturbance. I walk out of my bedroom and downstairs, at first thinking I imagined his voice. Because why would he be here? But his lingering scent was the key detail of him actually being here. I walk into my living area to find him standing, his back to me. I can feel the chemical reaction of the mate bond trying to encourage me to touch him, to give into that gravitational pull to once again experience those tingles that only a mate can give. I resist. “What are you doing here?” He never visits me, why now. “This is my pack, I can go wherever I want.” His voice holds an irritation to it. He has clearly been in night training; he is sweaty and dirty...his white tight vest now tingeing on the grey side, his jeans muddy from being left on the ground. His auburn hair now shaved down, not the long boyish strands I used to enjoy running my fingers through. He spins, his eyes turning a deeper brown as they flash at me...I’m only wearing a black slip. I thought I’d be alone as usual, no point dressing up for oneself. “Than, why are you here?” “I’ve incurred a slight problem...” “A slight problem? And I can help how?” He doesn’t respond to me, but he finds himself comfortable enough to walk into my kitchen and fetch my bottle of vodka. By the smell reaching my nostrils, he’s already downed a bottle of whiskey this night. I won’t talk to him like this, he can walk himself out. I head up the stairs, towards my bedroom when I hear his footsteps following me up the stairs. I turn to face him on the landing, his peculiar behaviour piquing my interest. His hand pulls at my arm, pulling me into him, his mouth taking me off guard as they almost touch mine. “It would seem I need to have a child...” His voice is cold...holding some kind of resentment. “A child?” I hide my scoff internally, as my wolf growls in my mind. She hates him, hates him for rejecting us. His eyes are on me now for my disrespectful comment. His aura increasing, an invisible command trying to force me to submit. He’s always struggled to make me submit and it gives me deep joy to know how much that grates on him. He doesn’t know why. “Can I ask why now? Where has this come from? Let’s not pretend that you have any feelings for me Than. Why bring a child up in this unloving and toxic environment?” I untangle myself from his hold and create some much-needed distance between us. “The pack needs an heir; you are the Luna after all.” He does what I was praying to the moon goddess for him not to do, he starts walking towards me. His prowling steps resulting in my spine to shiver. This man was your typical alpha...tall, muscles, predatory eyes to help seal the solve...but it’s the inside that sickens me. Yet there’s as part of me that hopes I have it wrong, that there has been some kind of misunderstanding between us since the wedding...because why would we be matched together? As he comes closer his scent tickles at my senses, the roasted chestnut smell now mixed with heavy pungent. He’s in front of me before I can do anything, his hand stroking at my face. A deep gulp forming in his throat, as if it pains him to touch me. As soon as his fingers are on me, I want to moan with pleasure from his touch, from the tingles that I hadn’t felt in so long. I’m entranced by the tingles that just naturally continue, as his mouth kisses the tip of my shoulder. He pulls at my black spaghetti slip strap, running his tongue across the skin. A guttural moan escapes me as my head rolls back. I push my wolf away, was it selfish of me to enjoy what was owed to me? What was destined to me? “It’s just a child Kaia...” He slurs on his own words as his hand grips at my neck, his hand angling my neck...a growl rumbling in his body. Just a child? How can he say that? The mate bond was already weaving its magic. His closeness was doing things to me, his scent overpowering my thought process. I hated how the mate bond reduced me to this. “Say yes...” His mouth are by my ear and I have to bite down on my tongue to keep myself. My body is lost in the lustful feel of his touch at my lower core as his other hand lifts under my hem and pushes my underwear aside. His other hand remains at my neck, keeping me upright as his thumb now creates circular motions at my private part. Would a child make him love me again? Would a child bring us closer? I don’t think so, how could I knowingly bring a child into a relationship where the father can’t be in the same room as the mother. “No!” I gasp out, my body now fighting against the mate bond. Waking up from its spell. “No?” He seethes in my ear, his hand tightening around my neck. “No, I said no.” I snarl at him, the tightness around my throat now hurting. I start to push him, but he is built like a brick wall. He doesn’t listen to my rejection, his hand continuing down below. “Get your hands off me...” I snarl at him, my teeth close enough to his face to bite. His jaw tense, as his eyes glare at me. He pushes me back into my bedroom where the back of my legs hit against the bed. I lift my leg to kick him where it hurts, to snap him out of his lustful haze. But he blocks my knee with his, pushing my legs apart. Still holding onto my throat, he pushes us onto the edge of the bed where I am locked in his hold, using all my strength to fight it. His other hand is now blocking my punches and clawing attempts, before I feel him grip tightly onto my buttock. I hear him unzip his jeans, the denim dropping to the floor. Before I know it, he thrusts into me, too hard. I can feel myself burning inside as he overstretches me. Something inside of me freezes, telling me that I want this child...the treacherous mate bond trying to convince me even now. Tears are flowing down my face as I struggle with his harsh thrusts. I’m pinned, not making any movement at all. His hand now off my neck and both pinning my body down. I can’t look at him, my eyes are slammed shut, I know I’ll relive this...I want the memory already gone. I’m not sure what the measure of time is but it feels like an eternity before I feel him chasing his own release. “Alora...” He lowly growls as I feel him climax. Tears escape me as I lay still. As he releases his tight hold on me, my hands clamp over my mouth to keep my sobs silent. Alora. She was the reason my marriage was a fake. She was my marital nightmare.   Chapter 2 - Beyond belief I couldn’t sleep, not with him next to me. He hasn’t moved, and I’m frozen as his arm lays across my waist, as if what had just happened was a happy thing for me. As if he were trying to keep me safe. My mind keeps going over and over what had just happened. Reliving every moment. He called out her name...her name. Alora. She was the person that Than loved deeply, she was the reason why he never gave our mate bond a chance. He has thrown it away for her! I don’t even know who she is, where she is. All I know from snippets of information is that she was in a coma, and Than could never get over her. That’s when I stopped trying to work on our mate bond. I couldn’t fight against something so strong that it would overpower a mate bond…. A mate bond that is designed by the Moon Goddess herself. I knew that no matter what I tried, how much I tried to change myself for him...I could never escape the curse of Alora. It was far better for my own wellbeing to just let them be. His use of her name whilst inside of me, as she lays in a coma, is enough proof that I will never be able to replace her in his heart. ................ When he woke up, I pretended to be asleep, I couldn’t look him in the eyes. When I finally went downstairs, I hoped he would have left, returned to the alpha house for breakfast. But my heart feels strained as I smell his scent in the kitchen. I sigh internally at the realisation that he has stayed. He plates up some breakfast food on the table, it didn’t matter what he made, I know I haven’t got the stomach to eat this morning. Usually, I can enjoy my food peacefully knowing I am alone. But I can’t eat, thanks to him I now feel awkward in my own house. He keeps looking at me, yet I can’t look at him. I can sense his regret, that he wants to apologise but I can’t hear it...not right now. “Kaia...” His voice calls out my name. My ears hearing it as if he were miles away, not sitting across the table from me. I didn’t even realise I was lost in deep thought. I finally look up at him as he places his cutlery on the table, his plate just as full as mine. Also untouched. The constant rubbing of his forehead informs me that he has a heavy hangover and is feeling remorse. “I...” He starts to speak, his mouth open but his mouth unable to form any words. I continue to look up at him, to see him in a distressed way when the door slams open...with Zane rushing in, closely followed by Freya. “Zane, now’s not a good time.” He growls lowly at the intrusion of his beta. An intrusion into my home. Something that was also starting to feel as if it were being taken away from me. “Apologies Alpha but the pack doctor has news...You won’t believe it but Alora is showing signs of waking up.” “What?” Than’s eyes are wide as he jumps to his feet, sprinting away. As he hastily tries to leave my house, he doesn’t even look back at me as he runs to the front door, followed by Zane. Their frantic departure leaves an unsettled feeling within me, my wolf trying to voice her concern. “What will you do if she really wakes up?” Freya quietly asks me as she picks up Than’s plate and takes it into the kitchen. “What can I do?” I shrug helplessly, as I push the plate aside, all appetite has completely left me now. I slowly stand up and willingly return to my room...to be alone. ……. My mind needed an outlet, it needed normality. To complete a task, I had some level of control over. Turning on my laptop I notice that I have received an email. Opening the email it informs me that there was still no progress on the investigation into Father. The email reads that there is a possibility that he might have been sighted at the Dark Phantom Pack. I haven’t seen Father since I was sixteen. Not since our pack was attacked and he asked my immediate departure. Closing the laptop, I look down at my wrist. I only now notice Than’s finger marks still evident from last night. Nausea overwhelms me and I rush into the bathroom and vomit into the toilet. Needing to clean myself, I manage to step into the shower, my lower core still sore from last night, from his overzealous actions. I wanted to wash him off me. I turn off the water and reach for a towel. As I dry myself off in front of the long mirror, I’m shocked to see the marks and bruises all over my body. The most prominent on my neck and back, how had I not noticed already? I’m littered with both physical and mental scars of what he has done to me. I must spend the next hour sitting at the edge of the bed, staring at myself in the mirror. Freya’s words recalling in my mind...“What will you do if she really wakes up?” What will I do if she wakes up? If she never wakes up, will I be able to survive like this forever? Perhaps seeing her will help me to decide, perhaps seeing her will answer some questions. I feel as if seeing her will shed some light on my confusion... I need to see her.... ..... That evening, I couldn’t stop my curiosity getting the better of me. I know I shouldn’t go, I should stay in my home, lock the doors and keep myself to myself. But I couldn’t help it, my intrigue was too strong. Against my better judgement I left my house and sneaked through the pack, everyone fast asleep. The pack at its quietest. I dressed to disguise myself. I didn’t need to bother with my hoodie, not one person stopped me or even recognised me when I reached the hospital. Some Luna I was eh? I followed my wolf’s intuition. Surely a person in a coma would be in the intensive care unit? I don’t even know what she looks like. All I have to go by is the name Alora. Keeping my face hidden as much as I can, I locate the patient board to find her assigned to room B5. It takes me a few moments to build up the courage to get into her room. Was I being disrespectful? Visiting someone who was in a coma? No, he’s betrayed me by choosing her over our mate bond. Denying my place as Luna because of her. I shouldn’t be here, this was wrong. But I can’t seem to control my own behaviour. I nervously push the door open, my eyes darting immediately to the girl attached to a ventilator for breathing. This was the person that has captured my mate’s heart so deeply that I never stood a chance? This was my competition? A girl that can’t even breathe by herself? This is who he has been holding back on me for, on our mate bond.... I slowly walk up to her, my hand already stretched out. My heartbeat becoming faster and faster until I get a closer look at the still body lying on the hospital bed. I take one last look at her before I... As my eyes gaze upon her, my body freezes like a statue before my eyes have a chance to catch up. She looks exactly like me? My heart continues to race and my head starts to rush, a dizzy spell threatening to take over me. Is that why I am here, why I am in this pack... Because I look like her?   Chapter 3 - A cold hearted mate She’s my double, identical to me. Her skin isn’t as olive toned as mine, she’s paler from having been away from the sunlight, from being stuck in this hospital bed...but there’s no doubt that she is my double. My mind can’t seem to process what my eyes are seeing. How was this even possible? I walk to the end of the bed, picking up her medical record to see what happened to her. Than never speaks of her. Apparently never letting anyone get close enough to visit her. Reading the report, it says she consumed wolfsbane. Wolfsbane? What would have possessed her to do that? Wolfsbane isn’t something you drink accidentally. It’s a controlled substance, it’s incredibly hard to get hold of. It’s meant to be excruciatingly painful to consume, an unbearable pain. I didn’t dare to stay here any longer. I mechanically put the medical record back and walked out of her room, off the entire hospital ward. I’m not even sure how I got back home. I must have gone into robot mode, my mind taking over as my body remained in a level of shock. I just feel like my legs are shaking all the time, only just keeping it together until I am alone in my own house. Once I close the front door my mind and body finally reconnect, and I have to hold onto the wall for support. My legs finally give way as I slowly fall against the wall onto the floor. My legs tuck into my heart, calling out for my arms to embrace them, which I do. I provide myself the only support I’ll ever get. I just sit on the floor trying to work on calming my breathing down. Why did Alora and I look so similar? She was skinny from being on life support, her face sunken but there was no mistaking our similarities. More than similarities, our mirror image. Wait...he approached me at college, made a point of introducing himself to me. Is that why? Because I look like her? Did he even feel the humming of our bond, the gravitational pull... Or did he only come up to me because I resembled his comatose beloved? I was an Alora substitute... I haven’t moved all night, my back sore from having sat all night in the same position, against the hard wall. What was I really doing here? This question has been plaguing me all night. That’s when I heard him. It must be the break of dawn for him to be outside on his way to training. Anger takes over me, my wolf using my bereaved state...because I was in bereavement, bereavement for a mate bond that will never be. For being tricked for too long. “I saw her!” I call out to him as I open my front door. He turns to face me before ushering his beta, Zane, to continue without him. “Saw who?” He walks closer to my house but doesn’t come in. I don’t think I want him in here now anyhow. “Alora.” His eyes that weren’t particularly interested in talking to me, now dart immediately to mine. “You have?” He takes a step closer to me, his arm now raised and leaning against the top of my porch. “Is that the only reason you spoke to me that day at college, because I look like her?” “Yes!” He answers too quick, too cold hearted. “Does the mate bond mean nothing to you?” I start to shake, my own words sounding higher than I anticipated. “How could you...” I whisper out. “Well now you know, there is nothing to hide.” He starts to back away, not even trying to fight for me once. Not even an apology...resulting in my anger boiling over. “You’re a dickhead, I hate you! Don’t come anywhere near me or my house again!” I scream out at him, slamming the door unable to look at him any longer. ........ 2 months later I haven’t seen Than once in the last 2 weeks. Not once. Rumour has it that he’s been by Alora’s bed side every day and night. Freya also informed me that the signs of her reawakening are becoming more and more evident. I’ve increasingly been feeling more uncomfortable in my own skin and with Than being constantly at the hospital it has afforded me a chance to secretly get a baby test. I’ve not had a chance to look at it yet, I’ve been standing here for 20 minutes unable to pick it up from the sink. What if I am? What will that mean for this sick weird love triangle I’m finding myself in? “Come on Kaia, we can figure it out together. Just look at it.” My wolf encourages me to find the strength to check the result. With her companionship and support, I find the courage to look at the results. “Two lines...” I gasp, my hand clasping at my mouth. “Two lines...that’s good right? Means a negative?” My wolf’s voice sounds in my head. “No, two lines is...” I check the box again just to be certain. “Positive. What am I going to do?” The positive test sat next to me all night on my bedside table. I couldn’t keep my eyes off it. I had to check it numerous of times in the night to make sure I read the results correctly. Pulling myself out of bed I knew I had to tell him. As much as I hate him right now, this child is still the pack heir. He’ll either be at the alpha home or the hospital, and I’d rather tell him without her being in the same room. Hence, I was already heading to the alpha house first to check. As I reach the front garden, both he and Beta Zane head out of the front door together. I’m not sure what possesses me to do so, but I hide behind one of the large trees as not to be seen. “Why not wait until Alora wakes up to have a child?” “We need an heir now, to strengthen the future of this pack.” “What if Kaia gives you a child, and Alora wakes up?” “Simple, the child is mine.” “And Kaia?” “If Alora wakes up, the wolfsbane has ravaged her kidneys to a stage of disrepair. Kaia will be the organ donor. She won’t have a choice! The doctors already know the score.” I stop listening, blood bumping in my ears blocking out any other noise. Organ donor? For her?   Chapter 4 - Making a decision I watch them walk away into the distance, my mind spinning at what I had just heard. Kidney donation? I never thought that Than’s purpose was to use my kidney to save Alora... This is ridiculous! So, from beginning to end I was a meaningless existence to him. He only thought of me as just an organ donor...even though we were mates for goddess’s sake. He was only with me for a kidney. How could he be like this...cruel! My brain couldn’t think anymore, and the strong buzzing of overthinking was giving me a splitting headache. What little hope I had was shattered and I couldn’t find any reason to continue living. “You need to remain strong...” My wolf’s encouraging words filter into my mind. “...you are with child.” “Yes, you’re right.” I wipe away my tears, I must stay strong for the baby. I couldn’t just sit back and wait for death. I now have an innocent child to fight for. Suddenly, I feel as if all eyes and ears of the pack are on me, all serving Than, spies all ready to betray me. I can’t remain, I can’t stay and wait for Alora to wake, wait for my death. I can’t trust anybody. I have no choice... Run! I must run... .... It’s been a week since I decided to leave, and I haven’t seen Than during this entire week. This morning Freya said that Alora had physical reactions, showing more signs of her imminent reawakening. Thinking she may wake in the next few days, I planned my escape already but have now pushed it forward to tonight. I couldn’t wait any longer. At midnight, I waited until the cover of darkness to executive my plan of escape. I try my best to avoid places where pack members were on duty. I knew I needed to get to the gate, hoping the midnight shift change may be my opportunity to elude the guards. I’m using the path that runs adjacent to the training field, thinking no one should be training now. Only to find Than exercising with a warrior... I duck behind a tree praying to the moon goddess that I hadn’t been seen. They both stop, looking towards the wooded area, my heart thumping as I hide behind a tree. “Kaia?” His eyes scan the area as I feel him push on my mind-link. He must have seen me after all. Closing my eyes to concentrate, I don’t give anything away. I make it seem like I am asleep...not even attempting to push him out of my mind. Only moving again when he returns to training. Now changing my route, I manage to get close to the gate remaining undetected. I watch from the shadows, waiting for the most opportune time to escape when the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I sense someone now behind me. “What are you doing?” Than finds me crouched down, a humorous smirk upon his face. Was my life funny to him? “I’m leaving Than. I’m not staying anymore.” I stand up, straightening my back. “I don’t think so...” He takes a step towards me but is interrupted by the warrior he was training with. “Alpha? Beta Zane says you need to return to the hospital...” “Not now.” “He says, she’s awake?” The warrior seems to not understand the own words relaying on his lips from the beta’s mind-link. Than stares me down for a moment before spinning on his heel, his warrior following him. I am now left alone, this was my only chance...her reawakening giving me a chance to leave. I don’t give the pack grounds another look, I run straight out of the gate. ........ I kept running until I reached the nearest city. It didn’t take long for Than to know I left through those gates...his warriors tracking me throughout the night. I manage to find a secluded coffee shop where I find time to rest, my feet are burning and my throat is dry from thirst. I have a baby and have no pack. What should I do now? I’m not entirely sure but I know no matter what challenges are ahead of me, I refuse to return to the Amber Desert pack...to Than. “You aren’t from around here, which pack are you from?” The silver haired elderly coffee shop owner asks as he refills my coffee cup. He’s been watching me for a while now, knowing I am not human like the other customers. “No, I’m looking for someone...someone who was last seen at a pack...” “Which pack?” He mutters under his breath, keeping his voice low. “The Dark Phantom pack?” I shrug my shoulders not expecting him to have heard of the pack, but I catch his eyes glaze over slightly into a mind-link. “What business have you with that pack?” “I’m trying to track someone down. Do you have a map? Can you show me the location?” I ask with slight hope, but he shakes his head before returning to his regular customers. I remain for around another hour, the owner ignoring my attempts at making eye contact with him. He hasn’t returned once to me but has all the other customers. I return my used coffee cup to the counter, readying to settle my bill when the cute bell rings signalling the door has been opened. That’s when the most intoxicating scent hits me. Burnt oranges with dark chocolate. The smell invades my nostrils, the scent causing my mouth to salivate. With my back on the door, I turn, but I already find a tall strong male engulfing my frame from behind. “I hear you’ve been asking about me?”     Chapter 5 - Negotiating my future “I hear you’ve been asking about me?” The tall man smiles slightly at me, his eyes remaining on mine. Our eyes lock together as something inside of me doesn’t want to look away. My head and eyes aren’t connecting...something is happening from the affect of his scent. Something I can’t quite register. His eyes are grey charcoal, like the ash left over from an extinguished fire yet still hold that ember warmth. He is well dressed, a slim fitting black suit with a grey tie...which purposefully brings out his eyes. He was exquisite. Groomed to perfection. My fingers are itching to run through his dark brown hair, to ruffle up the perfect hairstyle. I even clench my hands into fists to stop them from reaching up and touching him. It is only when he blinks, breaking the eye connection that my wolf finally pushes through this haze that I have been caught up in.... “Mate!” She screams for joy, her enthusiasm not quite as strong as mine...not just yet. Mate? How is that even possible? I match his slight smile, readying to respond when it occurs to me...why isn’t he reacting like me? He doesn’t seem to be struggling to breathe like I am. He is composed, his hands normal...not even slightly clenched to prevent them from pulling me into him. From claiming me as his. He’s acting as if everything is normal, as if I wasn’t also his mate. As if my mere presence wasn’t sending his wolf into disarray like it is me. I’d think I would have imagined it all. I am right, aren’t I? I’m not imagining it... “You were asking about me?” He clears his throat forcing me to wake up from the spell his presence has created on me. “About my pack?” His face now changes into a slight playful expression. “Your pack?” I repeat, still trying to refocus. “Yes, I am the Alpha of the Dark Phantom pack...” The Alpha? It would explain his strong aura that has taken over the coffee shop, even the humans are looking at him without realizing why. Their natural born senses flaring up which they now choose to ignore. It was clear he was a very powerful man. “Only that I’ve heard about it and was just curious.” I respond, trying to sound unbothered about the information now. I had to be careful here, if Father was last seen at his pack...they most definitely would have met. This pack was notorious, and I was now standing in front of the Alpha. I can’t let him know I am related to Father. I’ll have to continue to keep my identity a secret like before. Yet I am now a rogue and need somewhere to stay and lay low. A place I can reassess my future plans without living like an actual rogue. I don’t know why, but the Amber Desert and the Dark Phantom pack have had a long-standing hatred for one another. Than never mentioned the reason, in fact refusing that the enemy pack should ever be mentioned. If this alpha found out I was from Than’s pack..well I don’t want to think about it. I’ll have to keep it hidden that I am from the Amber Desert pack. “Perhaps I could join the Dark Phantom pack? I am looking for a new pack...” I place some money on the counter, acting cooly. As if I were ready to leave at any second...his pack not being the opportunity I now desperately needed. Even though it was classed as the enemy pack. “So you are a rogue?” He laughs out loud, his eyes continuing to watch me carefully. “Do you take in rogues?” “Becoming a Dark Phantom pack member requires...certain tests.” He winks before his eyes glaze over. “What kind of tests?” I ask, my eyes diverting to a male walking through the coffee shop door. “Strict tests...extensive running, fighting, using guns, jumping from rooftops...” The new male counts each test on his fingers as the alpha moves away from us, engaging in a small conversation with the coffee shop owner. He may be away from me now, but his eyes remain on me, readying to act. As if thinking I was going to run, little does he know I have nowhere to run. “...underwater breathing...” The new male catches my attention. “Underwater breathing? Whatever for?” I cut the man off, these tests were absurd and something I just couldn’t do. I couldn’t even shift right now. “I have other abilities I can bring to the pack...” I offer to the male as his fingers remain held up high in front of me as he has listed things I would be expected to do. “Oh?” The male’s eyes scan to his superior before the alpha sits on a high stool at the counter and takes a sip of coffee. “You really want to join my pack?” His eyes brighten slightly as he blows on the steaming hot coffee. My wolf was still howling in my mind, almost whimpering as his wolf doesn’t even recognize her. But things were different now, I needed a place to keep safe. A place to be protected from Than, because he will continue to look for me...I was Alora’s lifeline. He’d never give up. Although the Dark Phantom pack was known as dangerous, perhaps its reputation will afford me the protection I require. Perhaps being the enemy pack, Than won’t think to look here. “Yes.” I reply after a small pause. I also need to find Father; this pack might hold the answers I need. The alpha jumps up from his stool with a smile. A smile that quickly turns into a serious expression as he once again closes in on me. “I know who you are.”",https://www.facebook.com/61555427913037/,61555427913037,17 Feb 2025 - 18 Feb 2025 · Total active time 9 hrs,1.375,103
61558228850235,"""Linda, come back quickly! Your dorm has been trashed!""  Clutching my pregnancy test report, I hurried from the hospital to my dorm. As I approached the stairwell, a foul odor assaulted my senses.  ""Dump all the leftovers on her bed. Let's give her a fresh new scent! That shameless tramp! I treated her as my best friend, yet she hooked up with my boyfriend!"" Veronica shouted, hands on her hips, standing at the doorway.  Then, in the next second, she teared up in front of the camera, playing the victim.  ""My boyfriend is the renowned monk of Junopia. He only allowed me to stay by his side after I accompanied him for three years. But my so-called best friend, Linda Cameron, is a snake!   ""Each time he came to pick me up, she'd be scantily clad, gazing at him with longing eyes. She even resorted to vile tactics to bear his child…""  At this point, one of the girls who was smashing my things chimed in, ""Veronica is just too good-hearted. As her friends, we must rescue her relationship!""  ""Yeah! We'll defend Rick and Veronica's love!""  ""Protect Rick and Veronica's love!""  Their cries of faux righteousness filled the air as they continued to devastate my room.  A message popped up with a live stream link from a friend.   Opening it, I was greeted by the title, 'Woman Seduces Rick and Caught in the Act,' topped with a stark black-and-white photo of me.  At that point, I couldn't hold back any longer. I kicked open the door.  In that split second, the room fell silent. After a moment, they laughed mockingly.  ""The shameless homewrecker returns.""  ""If I were you, I'd just vanish. How do you still have the face to show up here?""  Veronica wiped away her nonexistent tears and acted pitifully in front of the camera as she said, ""Linda, I get it. You're jealous I have a boyfriend and a better life. But that's no excuse to hook up with him…""  'Boyfriend?' I tried to recall who Veronica's boyfriend was but failed. ""Who is your boyfriend?"" I asked genuinely.  When Veronica heard my words, her eyes widened as she said in disbelief, ""Don't you know Rick Wilson?""  'Rick? Isn't that Rayden's younger brother?' I thought. 'I can't believe I got married into the same family as my best friend.'  ""I've seen him a few times from afar, but we've never really interacted,"" I replied honestly.  However, Veronica felt that I was making up an excuse. She bit her lip, her eyes red and swollen, looking every bit the injured party.  The terms 'homewrecker,' 'Rick Wilson,' 'best friend,' and 'abortion' fueled a flood of viewers on the livestream.   The crowd vilified me while expressing sympathy toward Veronica. Some crossed lines, even dragging my family into their harsh judgments.  'I bet her mother's just as much of a slut as she is. Was her mother a homewrecker, too?'  'Who is her mother anyway?'  Seeing that the viewers were starting to dig into my family's background, I seized the phone and smashed it to the ground.  ""My phone! That was over 10 thousand dollars! You owe me for this!""  ""I'll cover it,"" I replied calmly.   But as a fleeting smirk began to form on her face, I gestured to the chaos around us. ""But only after you compensate me for all of this.""  My expensive four-piece bedding set reeked, my designer clothes were shredded, and my skincare and makeup were trampled underfoot, not to mention the word 'homewrecker' scrawled across my desk with my Hermes lipstick.  ""The clothes are custom-made, and it's worth several million. Although my lipstick only cost a few hundred since it's already been used, you still have to pay for it,"" I stated icily.  The group hesitated, looking to Veronica for guidance.  Veronica puffed up her chest and said nonchalantly, ""How can you afford these luxuries? Weren't they all gifts from my boyfriend?""  As I stared at her, the familiarity of our past friendship seemed like a distant memory. We had shopped for these items together, yet now she claimed them as gifts from her boyfriend.  ""I'm merely reclaiming what's rightfully mine as his true girlfriend. Don't worry, I'll deal with any repercussions.""  'Is she certain that I had snatched her boyfriend from her?' I thought.  Following her lead, her entourage grew more aggressive, attempting to force open my locked cabinet.  ""I wonder what dirty secrets she's hiding in here.""  Knowing it was pointless to reason with them, I took out my phone and was about to call the police. However, before I could dial the number, someone took my phone away.  Veronica's eyes lit up immediately as she leaped into the arms of the newcomer. Coquettishly, she cried, ""Rick, you're finally here!""  ""Who's messing with my girl?"" Rick questioned sternly, his prayer beads dangling from one hand as he encircled Veronica with his other arm.  Chapter 2 Rick Wilson  The girls surrounding Veronica looked at her with envy.  Facing Rick, I took a deep breath, reminding myself he was Rayden's brother and, hence, deserved some degree of respect.  Suppressing my anger, I forced a smile and said to Rick, ""Your girlfriend seems to have misunderstood our relationship. Could you please explain things to her?""  ""Stop with the nonsense!"" Veronica scoffed. ""I saw you leave the Wilson Family's house late at night last time. And now, there's a pregnancy test on the table. If you're not using the baby to wedge yourself into the family, what are you doing? Rick only loves me!""  ""The Wilson Family has more than just one son!"" I sneered.  Hearing my words, Veronica burst out laughing as if she had just heard the funniest joke. ""You can't be serious! Are you saying that you climbed onto Rayden's bed, the crown prince of Junopia?   ""The same one who completed his PhD at Harvale at just 16, launched his own business, became a leading figure in the industry within two years, and now wields control over international markets?""  I nodded, then shook my head.  After all, it was Rayden who tried to climb into my bed, but I firmly rejected him.  Amused, Rick chuckled and chimed in, ""Well, you've certainly piqued my interest by bringing up my brother.""  Veronica's mood shifted instantly; she clung tighter to Rick, pleading, ""You said I was your home, and other women were just hotels. You promised you'd always return to me.""  Rick soothed her with a pat on the head. ""Yes, you're home. But sometimes, I feel like visiting a hotel.""  Veronica looked heartbroken by his words, but she didn't dare say anything more.  Then, Rick swatted Veronica's hand away and eyed me up and down as he licked his lips. ""You seem familiar. Have we met at a club?   ""Anyway, I prefer natural beauty. How about you remove your makeup so I can see your real face? If you're not hideous, perhaps you could be my second wife, with Veronica as the first.""   His gaze dropped to my stomach. ""As for the baby, you should get rid of it. Veronica hasn't given birth yet, so you'll have to wait.""  Veronica's spirits lifted at his suggestion. Pouting, she said, ""Rick, I really don't like her.""  With another comforting pat, Rick assured her, ""It's alright. Try to be a bit more gracious. You'll always be my number one.""  After calming Veronica, Rick frowned upon seeing that I hadn't left yet.  ""Why are you still here? Hurry up and wash off that makeup."" He then gave Veronica a playful smack on her bottom and added, ""Go help her.""  Veronica nodded, a smug look crossing her face as she stared at me. ""As long as I'm here, you'll always be second best!"" She then led her group to corner me.  Outnumbered, I was shoved against the bathroom sink by Veronica and her gang. Water flooded into my eyes and nose, making it hard to breathe.  Through half-closed eyes, I caught a glimpse of Veronica's malicious stare and panicked.   Then, I summoned all my strength and broke free from their restraints. I happened to dodge the water she was about to pour onto me.  As the water splashed into the sink, it released hot steam.  It was boiling water. My heart raced at the near miss.  At that point, I was fed up with them.  I whipped out my phone and dialed the police. ""Hello, is this the police? There's an assault happening here.""  Meanwhile, Rick's mood shifted abruptly upon seeing my makeup-free face. ""You're a natural beauty,"" he remarked, seemingly impressed. ""Now, I will allow you to kiss me.""  I stared coldly at him as I thought about teaching him a lesson.  At the same time, Veronica's eyes were burning with rage. Still, she forced a smile and asked, ""Since we're practically family now, it's not too much to ask you to serve me tea, right?""  In lieu of tea, one of her friends handed me a bottle of water.  Looking at the smug Veronica, I suddenly remembered the first time we met.  At that time, she had risked herself and helped me chase away the classmate who was harassing me. Yet, we had now become enemies just because of a man.  With a flick of my wrist, I drenched her with the water.  ""Ah!"" Veronica shrieked.  Before she could lose control, the police finally arrived.  …  After the ordeal at the police station, Veronica clung to Rick, admonishing, ""You're being unreasonable, Linda. Why cause such a fuss? It's all Rick's money anyway.""  Rick fiddled with his prayer beads with his eyes closed.   Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked at me coldly. ""You don't need to scheme for my money. I'm always generous with women. Serve me and Veronica well, and you'll have a comfortable life.""   Then, he took out a check and said, ""Go to the hospital and get rid of the baby. I'll give you fifty thousand in exchange.""  I stared back unflinchingly and dialed a number on my phone. ""Hello? I'm pregnant, and someone's trying to kill your son.""  ""Where are you?"" The urgency in the voice on the other line was palpable.",https://www.facebook.com/61558228850235/,61558228850235,8 Feb 2025 - 9 Feb 2025 · Total active time 10 hrs,1.4166666666666667,5
61558228850235,"""That's wonderful, Tabby. I'm so happy that you're finally coming back after all these years."" The voice of a middle-aged man rose excitedly from the other end of the line. My uncle, David Norbury, was thrilled to hear from me. Just as the call ended, Luther Jansen opened the door to the room. Along with him, the scent of an unfamiliar woman's perfume wafted in. The scent was so sickly sweet that it stung my nose. ""Who were you talking to?"" Luther asked, his tone indifferent. He wasn't really curious. Even as he spoke to me, his eyes stayed glued to his phone screen. He was unwilling to spare even one glance my way. Just as I was about to answer, his phone rang again. A young woman's cloying, saccharine voice came through. ""Mr. Jansen, thank you so much for bringing me medicine the other day. Without you, my cold would've gotten so much worse. What would I do without you?"" Luther must have realized that his conversation with her wasn't entirely appropriate. He fumbled with his phone to lower the volume in a hurry. Feeling fed up, I decided to stay silent. I thought it was pointless for me to speak since we were already planning to get a divorce anyway. Quietly, I continued packing my things. Then, I made myself a customary glass of warm milk. After Luther finished his call, he sat on the couch and flipped through his financial newspaper as usual. He habitually reached out for the Earl Grey tea I always brewed for him. However, it wasn't there this time. He finally looked at me with an irritated expression as he snapped, ""Ugh! Is there a need for you to be so petty? All I did was fail to come to your aid when the elevator broke down. ""Sasha has a relative who's a doctor. He said your claustrophobia isn't even a big deal, so stop being so dramatic. Besides, you're the one who brought up divorce, and I agreed. Why the long face all day?"" Previously, I had worked late one night and ended up getting trapped in the elevator. The power had gone out completely, and my phone had been dying. At that moment, my claustrophobia had kicked in. With trembling hands, I had called Luther for help.  But all he had said was, ""Can't you figure it out yourself? I'm busy."" Then my phone had died, and I had blacked out. Later, I had found out that he had given his assistant, Sasha Knox, several days off. He had coincidentally been delivering cold medicine to her the evening I had gotten trapped in the elevator. And so, I had decided to file for divorce. ""Once the divorce is finalized, you won't have to deal with my long face anymore,"" I replied calmly, not letting it interrupt what I was doing. I thought Luther would be pleased. To my surprise, he suddenly raised his voice and exclaimed, ""Don't come crying to me when you regret it!"" When he didn't get any response from me, he grew frustrated and stormed out, slamming the door behind him. I was past the point of caring about his emotions. After finishing up, I drank my milk and took a hot shower. Then, I got ready for bed. Just then, a message from Luther came in. It read, ""I'm drunk. Come pick me up, and bring me a bottle of yogurt.""  I didn't want to go. But then, another message followed. ""We haven't gotten the divorce certificate yet. You still have to fulfill your duties as my wife."" Exhausted, I reluctantly grabbed my things and headed out. When I arrived at the club, Luther's voice and Sasha's grating laughter reached my ears immediately. This brought my thoughts back to the night when I first brought up divorce. That evening, Luther had also been drunk. One of his friends had asked, ""Luther, are you sure you want to divorce Tabitha?"" Luther had laughed dismissively and replied, ""She's just throwing a tantrum. Both her parents have already passed away. Where could she possibly go? Besides, isn't there a 30-day cooling-off period? If she regrets it, I'll be generous enough to take her back."" He thought I was alone and had no ties to anyone. Thus, he started to take me for granted, thinking no one would stand up for me. Funnily, he also assumed that was the reason I couldn't leave him.  Chapter 2 I pushed the door open. When Luther saw me, he seemed a bit surprised and immediately started frowning hard. He questioned, ""What are you doing here? Or could it be that you were following me?"" I held up my phone and gestured at him. ""You were the one who messaged me."" Sasha tugged on his arm playfully with a pout. ""Mr. Jansen, I played a prank and asked Tabitha to bring you a bottle of yogurt. You won't hold this against me, will you?"" Luther's furrowed brows relaxed immediately. Oddly, his indulgence toward Sasha's antics didn't stir any emotions within me. If this had been before, I might have reacted hysterically and lost my temper. This time, I remained calm and simply nodded to indicate that I understood the situation. For once, Luther seemed inclined to explain himself. ""Tabitha, Sasha is just here as my assistant for this social gathering—"" I cut him off by handing him the yogurt and didn't say anything more. Since he had been drinking, he couldn't drive. So, after making arrangements for Sasha to be sent home, he left with me. A cab was waiting across the street. As I walked ahead, Luther suddenly grabbed my arm and yanked me back just in time to avoid a speeding car that almost grazed me. If it hadn't been for him, I might've been seriously hurt. ""You don't watch where you're walking, do you?"" he scolded, sounding concerned. He then held my hand tightly in his. For a brief moment, I recalled how he used to hold my hand every time we crossed the street. It had been so long since something like this had happened. The sensation felt so unfamiliar to the point of almost being unsettling. Once we crossed the street, I discreetly withdrew my hand without a word. ... The next morning, I got ready for work. As I gathered my things and was about to head out, Luther offered to drive me. ""Let me take you to work."" Because of what had happened the previous night with him, I woke up later than usual. I would end up reaching the office late if I took the subway, so I agreed without fussing over it and headed to his car. When I opened the passenger door, the strong scent of a girlish perfume hit me. Inside, the seat covers were pink, and there was even a cute Poppy Purrs pillow on the seat. A small sticker on the dashboard read, ""Sasha's Special Seat"". Sasha had boldly staked a claim on her territory. The scene was ironic. The Luther I knew, who was supposedly meticulous and serious to a fault, had now allowed these childish decorations in his car. His expression turned a bit awkward. ""Sasha is just a kid. Don't mind her."" A kid, huh? So, he would take lovey-dovey photos with a ""kid""? I didn't voice my thoughts. On the second day after we filed for divorce, he had posted a sweet photo on his social media with the caption, ""Capturing every shy moment of yours."" Whether it was to spite me or for some other reason, I knew that Luther's heart had long strayed far away, where I couldn't see. Quietly, I opened the door to the back seat. ""I'll sit in the back."" ""You haven't eaten breakfast, have you?"" Luther asked, as though trying to ease the awkward atmosphere. He handed me a bottle of milk. I glanced up and noticed a box of snacks in the car that was filled with cookies, dried fruit, and jellies. I remembered how Luther used to have a strict no-eating policy in his car because of his obsessive cleanliness tendencies. Once, I had a hypoglycemic episode in his car. My lips had gone pale, and my vision had become blurry. I had been too weak to even speak. I had asked for a sweet beverage to alleviate my discomfort, but Luther had refused mercilessly. On the contrary, Sasha could easily have her way. The difference between love and indifference was glaringly obvious. I shook my head to decline the milk and turned my gaze to the passing cars outside the window. Thankfully, we reached the office quickly. So, I alighted and got to work immediately. Since we were divorcing, by right I should have submitted my resignation. But the thing was, I still had two projects to finalize. Out of a sense of responsibility, I decided to complete them before leaving for good. The morning and afternoon flew by in a blur due to work. As I was exhausted from the lack of sleep, I wasn't in great shape. I was just about to make myself a cup of coffee when a deliveryman came in carrying a large box of coffee and exquisite snacks. Cheers erupted from my colleagues. ""Wow, Mr. Jansen is treating us to afternoon tea! How generous!"" ""You don't get it. It's all because Sasha's on a diet, and Mr. Jansen feels bad for her. This afternoon tea is just an excuse so he can buy her some food. We're just riding on her coattails!"" Chapter 3 ""Huh? But isn't Mr. Jansen married to Tabitha?"" ""Shh! Keep your voice down. Tabitha is still here!"" ""We're just joking, Tabitha. Don't take it to heart."" I glanced at the spread of mango parfaits and chocolate cakes. Of course, it was for Sasha. Feeling bad that her dieting might harm her health, Luther had treated the whole office to afternoon tea. I was mildly curious as to how the snacks that were a testament to their love tasted. Unfortunately, I was allergic to mangoes and didn't enjoy chocolate. Back when Luther had courted me, he had been just as over-the-top. He had been worried about me skipping meals due to work and found excuses to make me eat by having me stay back with him to report my work progress. When I had fallen sick but insisted on working, he had secretly hidden medicine in a small cake. Then, he had convinced me to eat it just to see my expression as I grimaced from the bitterness. The once-dull office had become lively and filled with gossip as my colleagues watched our relationship blossom and unfold. But now, the recipient of all that affection and effort was someone else. I didn't have time to dwell on it, as my workload was overwhelming. I had already stayed late for several nights to meet the demands of this project. Unsurprisingly, I stayed back to work overtime again that night. The sky had gone completely dark by the time I realized someone was standing next to me. ""Tabitha, are you still working overtime?"" I looked up and saw Luther. I couldn't fathom why he had come to find me. ""Do you need something, Mr. Jansen?"" I asked. He seemed slightly uncomfortable with my formal tone but quickly got to the point. ""How about we let Sasha take over this project?"" Even though I had braced myself for this possibility, his words still stung. Luther continued, ""Sasha has been dealing with too many rumors lately. If this project is credited to her, her abilities won't be questioned anymore."" He knew how hard I had worked to secure this project. I had stayed up multiple nights, tirelessly pitching ideas and negotiating until my voice had become hoarse. Yet with one casual suggestion, he decided to hand it over to her. Every word he spoke was in defense of Sasha—to ensure she wouldn't be hurt by the gossip. However, he didn't for one second consider how unfair this was to me. I let out a soft, bitter laugh, finding it all too ironic. I said, ""Sure, I'll hand it over to her. Ask her to come to me tomorrow, and I'll pass the project to her."" I had already done more than enough for this company. With my resignation in mind, leaving Sasha to take over and handle the follow-ups was actually a relief. Luther seemed surprised by how quickly I agreed. He pulled out a jewelry box from his pocket and handed it to me. ""Didn't you say you wanted a necklace from this brand? I'm sorry for my behavior before. I should have known that women liked little things like these. I'll make it up to you from now on."" It was a necklace from the brand I liked. I had mentioned wanting one a long time ago, but he hadn't bought it for me when it mattered. Now, it felt meaningless. Besides, I didn't care for gestures that were done for the sake of appeasing or making it up to me after the harm was done. After I agreed to hand over the project, Luther's tone softened noticeably. He draped his jacket over my shoulders and said, ""Come on. Don't be mad at me anymore. I apologize for the elevator incident, okay? ""Let's withdraw the divorce application. You've always wanted to visit Dernby, right? I'll take you there when things settle down."" I didn't respond. He must have assumed my silence was an implicit agreement to go by his suggestion. After that, he went on and kept mumbling about a lot of things that I had no interest in. On my way home, I scrolled through my social media feed. That was when I saw Sasha's latest post that featured the same necklace brand and the same packaging. The only difference was that her necklace was far more beautiful and intricate than mine. It hit me then—what Luther had given me was just a promotional freebie. How ridiculous! Even though he knew what I liked, he couldn't be bothered to put in the effort to select a nice gift for me.  Chapter 4 The next day marked the last day of the divorce cooling-off period. After that, Luther and I would have nothing to do with each other. I was watering my plants on the balcony when the ring on my finger slipped off and fell over the edge. Instinctively, I leaned forward to try to retrieve it. ""What are you doing?"" Luther grabbed my arm and pulled me back forcefully. His eyes were filled with concern and urgency. ""Do you realize how dangerous that was?"" It almost seemed like he still cared about me. ""The ring fell,"" I replied. That ring was something he had made for me by hand back then. I loved its design, so I had been wearing it all this time. That was why I reacted so impulsively when it fell. He let out a breath he had been holding. ""It's just a ring. I can buy you another one. There's no need to do this."" Just a ring, huh? I glanced at his hand and noticed how bare his ring finger was. He had already removed his own ring long ago. ""Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary. I'll pick you up, and we'll spend it together,"" Luther offered. It had been so long since we had celebrated a wedding anniversary properly. I hesitated for a moment. Perhaps it was a way to put a dignified end to this marriage. ... The next day, I arrived early and sat in the private room at the restaurant we had reserved in advance. I had been waiting for a long time. My stomach had started growling with hunger, but Luther still hadn't shown up. I picked up my phone to call him. If he didn't intend to celebrate our wedding anniversary, he could have told me outright instead of wasting my time and leaving me to wait here. After my calls went unanswered, I glanced at my phone screen and saw that something was posted in the work group chat. An anonymous account wrote, ""Sasha seduced her married boss. She used her youth and looks to sleep her way up the ladder—how shameful!"" Attached to the message was ""evidence"" of me transferring the project to Sasha. Although the message condemned Sasha, the words implicated me. Not long after I saw it, Luther barged in furiously after kicking the door open. He shouted, ""I thought you willingly handed over the project. I can't believe you can be so vile! You agreed on the surface while scheming behind my back to slander Sasha! Tabitha, how can you be so despicable?"" Sasha stood behind him, sobbing pitifully as if she had been deeply wronged. She wailed, ""I don't need the project. I don't care what they say about me. But, Tabitha, I've always seen you as a good friend. Why would you do this to me?"" ""It wasn't me,"" I stated calmly. ""Since I already agreed to let her take over from me, I wouldn't stoop to something like this."" Luther retorted vexedly, ""Who else has a reason to target Sasha but you? You're such a hypocrite! Sasha went out of her way to pick this restaurant for us, but you don't deserve such kind treatment!"" He got so angry on Sasha's behalf. So much so that he even smashed a plate right in front of me. The shattered pieces scattered across the floor. After more than ten years together, he still didn't trust my character. I reached into my bag and pulled out the divorce agreement. ""Since that's how you feel, we should finalize this now. The 30-day cooling-off period is over anyway."" I placed my resignation letter underneath the agreement. Luther let out a cold laugh and grabbed the pen to sign his name without thinking. ""As you wish!"" With that, he took Sasha's hand and left with her. I sat at the table, watching his retreating figure. Well, there was no point in spending one last wedding anniversary together anymore. I turned to the cold dishes on the table and quietly ate my plate of pasta. When I was done eating, I grabbed the suitcase in the corner that I had already packed beforehand. Then, I took a cab and went to the airport. On the way there, I sent Luther a message. ""The keys are on the coffee table. It's over between us. Don't ever contact me again."" After sending it, I turned off my phone and boarded a flight to Naderton.",https://www.facebook.com/61558228850235/,61558228850235,18 Feb 2025 - 19 Feb 2025 · Total active time 15 hrs,1.625,65

61558228850235,"I walked out of the morgue, suddenly recalling that Aaron Tomlinson had not touched me intimately for three whole years. The last time we did the deed, he'd just entered my body when he uttered beneath his breath, ""So loose."" He had spoken softly, but I still heard him. And from that day onward, Aaron never laid a finger on me again. I didn't ask him for it either. Although I wanted nothing more than to ravage his extremely fit six-pack body and handsome face that rivalled any other celebrity, I still held myself back. Once the company started turning a profit, I tried everything I could to make myself look as pretty as possible. However, that still didn't attract Aaron's attention because he still refused to touch me sexually. As it turned out, he'd just been releasing his pent-up sexual frustration with someone else. I probably wouldn't even have been this angry if he'd reconciled with his ex-girlfriend, but he actually slept with my younger cousin, Rachel Sanders, of all people. He knew very well that Rachel had already stolen three of my ex-boyfriends away. He knew that Rachel and I could never get along. After the funeral, Rachel kept bugging Aaron, asking him to send her back home. Aaron just patted her on the head fondly and said, ""Alright, I'll send you home."" Then, he turned to me and said, ""Katrina Sanders, take the car and attend the meeting at the office first. You've been on leave for days. Your department's basically collapsed."" After he was done speaking, he didn't even wait for my reply before he opened the door to the front passenger seat for Rachel. I was very shocked. Since when had Aaron ever been so gentlemanly like this? He had never, ever opened the car door for me, even after our marriage. It wasn't until I walked out of the door that I realized it was pouring outside. When I saw the heavy rain, I was immediately reminded of the time I miscarried my first child because of such sheeting rain. It happened because Aaron and I were hurrying to meet a potential client who was trying to sign with another company. I drove past the speed limit while six months pregnant. We managed to secure the client, but because of how bumpy the entire ride had been, I'd accidentally caused the death of my unborn baby, and I was forced to undergo an induced miscarriage. That was why Aaron complained about me being ""loose"" down there afterward. From that day onward, I had always been fearful of such a heavy downpour. If the rain was as heavy as this, I wouldn't be able to focus while driving. I took out my phone and called Aaron. The morgue was very far from the city, and the road was long and dark. It was also close to impossible to get a designated driver to drive my car back. My only hope was Aaron. The phone rang for a long time before he finally picked up. I could hear the frustration in Aaron's voice when he spoke. ""What is it?"" I was just about to speak when I suddenly heard Rachel's moan on his side of the line. ""Ronnie, s-slow down… It hurts… Why must you do this a dozen times a day? Isn't she giving you any at home?"" Aaron probably threw his phone to the side without hanging up, thinking that he did. I then heard him say shamelessly, ""She can put on the most expensive perfume she wants, but it still can't mask the smell of smoke or alcohol on her. ""The cigarette smoke must be from some random guy she's seeing. She smells nothing like you. You smell young and sweet."" At that moment, my tears suddenly gushed out of my eyes as if a dam had just broken. Were they doing it in the car? The car Aaron drove was an MPV, the first car we bought after making our first bucket of gold at the company. I had personally decorated the interior myself because I liked sleeping in it. I bought the best and most expensive faux fur rug because I liked the convenience of having a comfortable place to rest if I had too many drinks when meeting with clients over dinner and wine. I'd told Aaron that nobody else was to touch the backseat, but he clearly didn't care. He also said that he hated how I often smelled like smoke and alcohol. But it wasn't as if I had really wanted that to happen. Our company was still considered a start-up, and he handled the creative side of things because he wasn't cut out for discussing business with potential clients or investors. So, I was the one who did it instead. Usually, these big clients and investors would only talk business with me over dinner and wine, with an extra smoke or two. I hated the stench of cigarette smoke, but I still forced myself to put up with it. I just never thought that it would become one of the major points that turned Aaron off about me. Chapter 2 I waited close to three hours for the rain to stop. When it finally did, I drove home at the speed of a snail. By the time I reached home, it was close to 3:00 am. Aaron was fast asleep in the living room, hugging a huge plush toy Rachel gave him last year. I finally lost my temper and shook him awake. Aaron woke up and instantly started shouting at me. ""What the hell? Why did you wake me up so late at night?"" I took a deep breath and stared at his handsome face. Still, I decided to speak my thoughts with determination. ""Aaron, let's get a divorce."" He still looked sleepy before I spoke, but now, he stared at me with wide eyes and in disbelief, as if he'd just thought of something. He continued staring at me with some sort of guilt in his eyes. ""You found out, didn't you, Katrina? Fine. I'll cut all ties with her."" He hurriedly went to grab his phone and started tapping on some buttons, blacklisting Rachel's number. Then, he carefully looked up at me. ""Kat, I've already blacklisted her. Can we please not get a divorce?"" I stared back at him. Then, while he let his guard down, I suddenly hugged him and tried to be intimate with him. Aaron immediately jumped backward like he'd been electrocuted and pushed me off. He then glared at me as if I was a horrible witch trying to force myself on him. I looked at him and chuckled. ""Aaron Tomlinson, how could you still say no to the divorce when you're acting like this with me?"" It was only then that he realized he'd pushed me off very roughly just now. He then looked at me with a helpless expression. ""Kat, I'm sorry for treating you coldly for the past three years. Wait for me for a while."" He then fetched the first-aid box and brought out a bottle of pills. When I saw what it was, I immediately slapped it to the ground. ""Aaron Tomlinson! Did you think I would want you to take these kinds of pills before getting intimate with me? ""It's fine if you don't love me anymore. Just admit it and we can go our separate ways on a good note."" Aaron's hand trembled. His gaze then turned dark. ""Must you divorce me?"" I nodded without a doubt. From the start of our marriage, I knew that someone as smart and handsome as Aaron would have many women pursuing him. I used to have faith in our relationship and thought that he would never divorce me. I even once thought that as long as he still loved me, I could forgive him if he slept with someone else. However, I didn't think that he would also stop loving me. I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't bear it anymore. Aaron walked into the study and fetched a stack of documents before throwing it on the table before me. ""Kat, you know that you attract a lot of attention every time you go out drinking with the clients. I've always been afraid that they would one day steal you away. ""That's why I had a backup plan. If you divorce me, you'll be the one paying the price."" I flipped open the pages and looked at Aaron. It seemed that I had never quite understood him after all. I thought that he was only good at creative things. I never thought that he would lay a trap for me in the partnership contract that we signed. If we got divorced, then I would be left penniless and wouldn't get a single dime from the company. Back when I signed the contract, I was so focused on pursuing him that I didn't carefully review the details. All I knew was that Aaron would now be forever tied to me. He would put me in charge of all his projects, and I would make them come true for him. I was going to make him unable to leave me. Aaron had given me 55% of the company's shares, and that made me lower my guard even more. I thought that he didn't love money as much as I did. It was also because I thought he was this naïve that I fell in love with him even more. But in the end, Aaron only knew how to handle the creative side of things. On the other hand, I loved money, so I could bring our business to the highest value possible. Then, I would sell off all of my shares. When that time came, someone else would be in charge of the company, and he would no longer be able to create as he pleased. They also probably wouldn't be able to sell his creations, fetching high praises and prices from our industry of work. I used to love him and wanted him to stay by my side forever. That was the only reason why I kept looking out for him. But since he no longer loved me and even betrayed me, I had no reason to continue helping him with his dreams. Still, I had to calm him down. I couldn't let him know that I was planning to sell off all my shares. So, I looked at him emotionlessly and said, ""Fine, we won't divorce."" Aaron grinned gleefully in satisfaction. ""Isn't that great? I'm sorry I can't give you the love you want, Katrina, but I can still give you the money that you want.""  Chapter 3 I looked at Aaron. I couldn't believe that he just gaslighted me. In that case, he really wasn't the pure, kind-hearted, and multi-talented Aaron Tomlinson that I used to know anymore. Who told him that I didn't deserve his love just because I loved money? It was true that I loved money, but I had all the means to earn it by myself. My parents hadn't invested tons of money into my education for more than 20 years for nothing. I'd worked so hard for years. It couldn't possibly be for covering up my partner's dirty, filthy undoing, could it? The next morning, everyone looked at me weirdly at the company. My assistant, Megan Walters, pulled me aside and said, ""Ms. Sanders, I think it's best if you don't hurry into your office for now."" I could kind of guess what happened. So, instead of heeding her advice, I marched toward my office in a haste. When I reached the entrance, I saw that Aaron was cuddling Rachel in his lap while feeding her a steaming plate of spaghetti. Aaron was even patiently twirling the pasta onto a second fork while waiting for her next bite. I felt tears welling in my eyes. I couldn't breathe. I recalled the last time he blew up at me when I ate a muffin in his office. He'd berated and humiliated me in front of all my other colleagues for it. He even gave me the cold shoulder for three whole months without ever speaking to me. I just learned that Aaron wouldn't mind anyone else eating in his office if he loved her. When Rachel caught sight of me, she grinned triumphantly at me before kissing Aaron on the cheek. I recalled the times when she would go after every crush I had. Then, she would break up with them once she'd had her fun. When I finally tore her a new one, she simply said, ""My parents often compared me to you, saying that you were so smart and I was such a failure. ""So, I'm just proving to them that whatever you put your effort into getting, I can just easily snatch it away from you whenever I want! And it's not like I want anything that you want, anyway. I can't even be bothered with them after I'm done ruining your fun."" It was bad enough in the past, but Aaron was someone I'd invested too much of my time and effort in. I just couldn't bear to see Rachel destroying him before my very eyes. I rushed into the office, grabbed the plate of spaghetti, and threw it directly into the trash. Rachel immediately made it as if she was going to grab it back, but she purposely put her hand under the falling noodles so that the steaming hot sauce would scald her hand. Then, she screamed in pain. Aaron immediately pulled her away and ran her hand under running tap water. He kept talking to her in a gentle voice, trying to calm her down. ""How could you be so dumb to try and stop the spaghetti with your bare hands?"" Rachel turned to Aaron with her watery eyes and said, ""B-But you made me that spaghetti yourself…"" Aaron then brought Rachel to me and said sternly, ""Katrina Sanders, apologize to your cousin."" I chuckled. ""She was the one who wanted to stop it. And she only did that because she's trying to get your sympathy. ""Aaron Tomlinson, as your wife of many years, let me give you some advice. She's only playing with you. She doesn't care about the consequences, but if anyone else were to find out about you two, you're the one getting destroyed."" Rachel just stared at me like I was an idiot. However, when Aaron looked at her, she gave him a shy, innocent look. Then, Aaron glared at me and said, ""Even if that was true, it would be with my consent. It's hard for me to find someone who is so emotionally and sexually compatible with me. ""It's like, I am compatible with you in terms of business. We can start a company together and build it up together, but it's simply impossible for us to get physically close. I can't even touch you. So, how would you ever understand what I'm feeling now?"" As soon as Aaron was done talking, Rachel suddenly laughed disdainfully. It was only then that I realized Rachel had pressed the intercom button the whole time. This button had been previously installed so that Aaron could summon whoever he needed into his office for quick meetings. The intercom was like a company-wide megaphone. Anyone would be able to hear what was going on inside the office if it was pressed. In other words, the entire office heard our exchange as well. Rachel was just having her fun. Of course, she wouldn't care about any consequences. I looked at Aaron, but he didn't seem to mind. He just spoke again, pressing on the button, saying, ""Whoever leaks out the conversation earlier will have their year-end bonus revoked."" Rachel then started drawing circles on Aaron's abdomen. ""My hand still hurts. How are you going to compensate me?"" Aaron continued blowing on her hand, which showed absolutely no signs of redness or swelling, and asked fondly, ""Well, what is it that you want, love?"" Rachel's eyes glinted. ""I want you right here. I'm not as smart as Katrina, so I've never been able to have such a big and luxurious office. It's going to be so thrilling and exciting here!"" She then turned to me and said, ""Kat, you don't mind, do you? You only love money, after all, and you're getting old. I'm sure you won't be able to be sexually satisfied like this anyway."" Aaron just looked at me with a conflicted expression on his face. I held the highest rank in this company, and I was his wife. He knew that he still had to show me some respect. However, Rachel then slid her hand inside his pants and moaned, ""Ronnie, give it to me…"" Aaron couldn't hold back anymore and hugged Rachel tightly. Rachel just gloated at me and grinned. ""Kat, do you want to take a photo to commemorate or something? Or would you like to close the door for us?"" I stared at Aaron, who was hurriedly feeling Rachel up. At that moment, I felt my heart shattering into a million tiny fragments. Aaron knew that the whole company was looking and listening in, but yet he still decided to humiliate me and crush my dignity like this. He truly never cared about me at all. I chose the latter. I went out of the room and quietly closed the door behind me. I turned around and saw that Aaron's assistant, Carson Flint, was arriving with some of our partners and investors who were helping us get listed tomorrow. I should have reminded Aaron about it, but since he didn't care, who was I to interfere? I had known for a long time that Carson was a business spy sent by one of our rivals. I was planning to fire him today and save Aaron the headache afterward. But now, I couldn't care less about it. At this point, Carson could film whatever he wanted. I bet he would try to ruin the company before it gets listed tomorrow. I went back to my office and sold off all my shares. Then, I bought a plane ticket for myself. Looking at the white clouds passing by outside my window, I felt a burden lifted from my shoulders. Finally, I was leaving.",https://www.facebook.com/61558228850235/,61558228850235,31 Jan 2025 - 1 Feb 2025 · Total active time 14 hrs,1.5833333333333335,23
